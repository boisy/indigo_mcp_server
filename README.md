# Indigo MCP Server

Use Large Language Models (LLMs) to get stuff done(tm) in Indigo.

## Getting Started

- Download the Claude client from https://claude.ai/download
- Install the FastMCP Python library (pip install fastmcp)
- In Claude, go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config
- Copy the contents of the mcp_config.json file into the configuration file (update the path to the args value in the script)

Once this is done, relaunch Claude and ask it a question like "Show my Indigo folders."
